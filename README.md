# ami-e
```Ami-e``` is a mini-contact app, built with vue, axios, tailwind, CSS3 and love, and deployed on netlify.
Ami-e is a name derived from the word ```Ami``` which means ```friend``` in ```french``` as it is built with all the love in tis word and meant to be a companion worthy of being man's best friend. The ```-e``` was added to ensure it is not gender biased and support all the great and strong ```women``` out there. So instead of being ```ami``` or ```amie```, we decided tonne oirselces. Your try friend...
