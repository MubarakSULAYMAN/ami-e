# ami-e

**`Ami-e`** is a mini-contact app, built with vue, axios, tailwind, CSS3 and love, and deployed on netlify.

Ami-e is a name derived from the word `Ami` which means `friend` in `french` as it is built with all the love in this world and meant to be a companion worthy of being man's best friend. The **`-e`** was added to ensure it is not gender biased and support all the great and strong :womens: `women` out there. So instead of being either `ami` or `amie`, we decided to be ourselves.
